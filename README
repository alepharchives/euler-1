#The Plan

Work thru "projecteuler" projecteuler.net.


Pick from "thelist" at least one language for each problem.

"thelist" must be selected from the github page of languages https://github.com/languages


#Problem:

Each problem will have its own folder, and each folder below that will be for which ever language I tackle it in from my "Short list".

ie.
	1
	|-- arc
	|-- R
	2
	|-- Io
etc

 
	Ada          Boo              C
	D            Erlang/Eiffel    F#
	Go           Haskell          Io
	Java         Lua              Python
	R            SuperCollider    Tcl
	Vala
